T5X is essentially a new and improved implementation of the [T5 codebase](https://github.com/google-research/text-to-text-transfer-transformer) (based on [Mesh TensorFlow](https://github.com/tensorflow/mesh)) in [JAX](https://github.com/google/jax) and [Flax](https://github.com/google/flax).

We provide scripts for using t5x for assertion generation.

This part is additional and is not covered in our paper.
